# Elixir ads reports

Client-facing performance reports for Elixir Social's Meta ads (account 1358051173168970).

- `index.html` — **Creative Ledger**, a lifetime creative-wise report snapshotted 25 September 2026, 10:20 pm IST.
  Self-contained: the figures are baked into the file, so it needs no network and no connector.
  Campaign rail, per-ad tables, day-by-day, age bands, and the GST-inclusive billing line.
  Defaults to the campaigns that are active; a switch shows all nine.

**"Why the cost per registration moved"** sits on each campaign. Cost per registration is
exactly CPM divided by registrations per 1,000 impressions, so the card plots all three on
one day axis: a rise is either dearer impressions or a weaker response, and the shapes say
which. Under it, a creative-by-creative split compares two equal windows of settled days
(the part-day is excluded from both) and labels each ad — *impressions costlier* is a price
problem, *response fading* is the one a new creative fixes.

That split reads `ADAY`, ad-level day rows for the campaigns that are still running, indexed
by `ANAME`. **`ADAY` has to be refreshed alongside `DAILY`** or the split silently goes stale
while the charts above it move.

A second live campaign, **India | MBBS Students - influencers** (`120249585873390482`),
opened on 24 Sep 2026 on its own ₹3,000/day budget alongside the original ₹3,000/day
campaign. Account spend roughly doubled that day — that is a deliberate second campaign,
not a budget change on the first. It runs the same three influencer creatives, and so far
only `Influencer - 11sep` has any real delivery in it.

The page carries `noindex, nofollow` so it stays out of search results.

A live version of the same report — one that queries Meta each time it is opened — is kept
as a private Claude artifact rather than here.

## A rename can hide a creative swap — check the activity log

**This bit the report on 23 Sep 2026.** Two ads were renamed at Meta and the
refresh carried their whole history forward under the new names. It was not a
rename: the *creative was replaced on the same ad id*, so Meta reported
`v4 — Ecg`'s 837 installs and 313 registrations under
`influencer direct video ad — Rheumatoid Arthritis`, a video that had produced
**nothing**. The client spotted it, not the reconciliation — every total still
balanced, because the numbers were real, just attached to the wrong creative.

The tell is in `ads_account_get_activity_logs` (`event_category: "ad"`), which
records all three events together:

    Ad updated        old_value ["2154354885490353"] -> new_value ["956543453540710"]
    Ad name updated   "v4 - Ecg" -> "influencer direct video ad - Rheumatoid Arthritis"
    Ad status updated Inactive -> Pending Process -> Pending Review -> Active

A pure rename never triggers Pending Review. **If a name changed, pull the
activity log before carrying history forward.** If the creative changed too,
split the ad into two rows at the swap date:

- the retired creative keeps everything up to the day before, status `REPLACED`
- the new creative starts from the swap day, with its own ranged pull for reach

and **append** the new names to `ANAME` while restoring the old names at their
original indexes — every historical `ADAY` row still points at the creative that
actually ran.
